                            <p>Apple  (Malus sp., Rosaceae) is cultivated worldwide as a fruit tree, and is the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The apple tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today.</p>

                            <p>Phenolic compounds, such as polyphenol oxidase, are the main driving force behind browning in apples. Polyphenol oxidase catalyzes the reaction of phenolic compounds to o-quinones causing the pigment to turn darker and therefore brown.

                            <h4>Benefits Of Apple</h4>
                            <p>Apples are a rich source of dietary phytochemicals such as flavonoids. They also contain high levels of polyphenols and other phytochemicals. Polyphenols in apples and their extracts (juices) have been studied in several human studies that have shown promising results related to their beneficial effects 8). For example, consumption of at least one apple a day was reported to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer 9). The study also predicted that the risk of colorectal cancer reduced by approximately 50% upon consumption of more than one apple a day....</p>

                            <p>Most commercially important melons are sweet and eaten fresh, though some varieties can be made into preserves or pickled.</p>

                            <p>The sweet flesh of honeydew is typically light green, while its skin has a white-yellow tone.

                        <h2>Dragon Fruit</h2>
                        <div class="product-details">
                            <p>Dragon fruit grows on the Hylocereus cactus, also known as the Honolulu queen, whose flowers only open at night.The plant is native to southern Mexico and Central America. Today, it is grown all over the world.
                            It goes by many names, including pitaya, pitahaya, and strawberry pear.The two most common types have bright red skin with green scales that resemble a dragon — hence the name.</p>
                            <p>The most widely available variety has white pulp with black seeds, though a less common type with red pulp and black seeds exists as well.Another variety — referred to as yellow dragon fruit — has yellow skin and white pulp with black seeds.</p>

                            <h4>Uses of Dragon Fruit</h4>
                            <p>For the most part, dragon fruit is safe to eat and offers many health benefits due to its vitamin C and antioxidant properties. The fruit is low in calories, making it a perfect everyday snack
                            </p>
                            <h4>Benefits Of Dragon Fruit</h4>
                            <p>Animal studies suggest that dragon fruit may provide various health benefits.Many of these are likely due to its fiber and antioxidant content.
                            Both red and white varieties of dragon fruit have been shown to reduce insulin resistance and fatty liver in obese mice (11Trusted Source, 12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).In one study, mice on a high-fat diet who received an extract of the fruit gained less weight and had reductions in liver fat, insulin resistance, and inflammation, which were attributed in part to beneficial changes in gut bacteria (13Trusted Source).Dragon fruit contains prebiotic fiber that promotes the growth of beneficial bacteria in your gut — potentially improving metabolic health.Although this fruit may improve certain features of metabolic syndrome — a condition associated with type 2 diabetes — not all effects may be favorable.In a study in mice on a high-fat, high-carb diet, the group that received dragon fruit juice had better blood sugar responses and reductions in some liver enzyme markers, while another liver enzyme marker significantly increased...</p>
